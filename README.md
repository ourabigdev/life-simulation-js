# Life Simulation JS

Welcome to the Life Simulation JS project! This project is an engaging exploration into cellular automata and life simulation using JavaScript. Inspired by the fundamental principles of physics, specifically Newton's laws of forces, this simulation aims to recreate the dynamic and complex interactions between particles, mimicking the behaviors of atoms that combine to form living creatures.

## üöÄ Features
- **Physics-Inspired Movement:** Utilizes concepts from Newton's laws of forces to drive the motion of particles within the simulation, offering a realistic and scientifically grounded approach to particle dynamics.
- **Complex Systems:** This project represents my most advanced endeavor to date, attempting to simulate the intricacies of life at a microscopic level. Particles in this simulation behave like atoms that must interact and combine to form complex structures, potentially leading to the emergence of life-like entities.
- **HTML5 Canvas Rendering:** For the first time, I am employing HTML5 Canvas to render the simulation, providing a robust platform for visualizing the complex interactions of particles in real time.

## üõ† Development Status
- **Current Phase:** The project is still in the early stages of development. As such, it is actively being improved, with new features and optimizations being added regularly.
- **Beginner-Friendly:** As a beginner in JavaScript, this project serves as a significant learning opportunity for me. I am keen on developing my skills in both JavaScript and simulation development through this hands-on project.
